This website is intended to act as an entry point for anyone interested in learning more about and designing for inclusivity.
Its approach is not to be instructive, but to facilitate exploring the existing learning resources available online.
Inspired by [this conversation on Twitter](https://twitter.com/SelkeyMoonbeam/status/657052135972990976), the philosophy behind this website underlines the fact that, even with modern search engines it can be difficult to find the right starting point when trying to learn a new discipline, and even more difficult to find mentorship.
This is especially true of learning about inclusivity, as it is an ethical concern that should be shared by all people, but is often marginalized and ignored, especially in institutions of learning and work.
